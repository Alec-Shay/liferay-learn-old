## Tutorials for Customizing Liferay Commerce

This tutorial is meant to quickly demonstrate deploying custom modules to extend the features of Liferay Commerce. Starting from just basic experience with Java, this will show you how to leverage various extension points to add to the base functionality however you see fit.

You will be able to immediately delve into deploying sample modules for each of the available extension points. You will then be able to walk through the steps to build it yourself with your own customizations.

See [the list of tutorials](../README.md#extending-and-customizing-liferay-commerce) to get started.
