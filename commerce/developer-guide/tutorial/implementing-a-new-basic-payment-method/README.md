# Implementing a New Basic Payment Method

This tutorial will show you how to add a new basic payment method by implementing  the `CommercePaymentMethod` interface.

Liferay Commerce provides several out of the box payment methods including _Authorize.Net_, _Mercanet_, _Money Order_, and _PayPal_.

## Deploy an Example

In this section, we will get an example payment method up and running on your instance of Liferay Commerce. Follow these steps:

1. Start Liferay Commerce.

    ```bash
    docker run -it -p 8080:8080 liferay/commerce:2.0.2
    ```

1. Download and unzip [Acme Commerce Payment Method](./liferay-b1c3.zip).

    ```bash
    curl liferay-b1c3.zip
    ```

    ```bash
    unzip liferay-b1c3.zip
    ```

1. Go to `b1c3-impl`.

    ```bash
    cd b1c3-impl
    ```

1. Build and deploy the example.

    ```bash
    ./gradlew deploy -Ddeploy.docker.container.id=$(docker ps -lq)
    ```

    >Note: This command is the same as copying the deployed jars to /opt/liferay/osgi/modules on the Docker container.

1. Confirm the deployment in the Liferay Docker container console.

    ```bash
    STARTED com.acme.b1c3.internal.commerce.payment.method_1.0.0
    ```

1. Verify that the example new basic payment method was added. Open your browser to `https://localhost:8080` and navigate to _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Settings_ → _Payment Methods_.

Congratulations, you've successfully built and deployed a new basic payment method that implements `CommercePaymentMethod`.

Next, let's dive deeper to learn more.

## Walk Through the Example

In this section, we will take a more in-depth review of the example we deployed. First, we will annotate the class for OSGi registration; second we will implement the `CommercePaymentMethod` interface; and third, we will implement the payment method logic.

### Annotate the Class for OSGi Registration

```java
@Component(
	immediate = true,
	property = "commerce.payment.engine.method.key=" + B1C3CommercePaymentMethod.KEY,
	service = CommercePaymentMethod.class
)
public class B1C3CommercePaymentMethod implements CommercePaymentMethod {

	public static final String KEY = "Example";
```

>It is important to provide a distinct key for our payment method so that Liferay Commerce can distinguish our new payment method from others in the [payment method registry](https://github.com/liferay/com-liferay-commerce/blob/2.0.2/commerce-payment-service/src/main/java/com/liferay/commerce/payment/internal/method/CommercePaymentMethodRegistryImpl.java). Reusing a key that is already in use will override the existing associated payment method.

### Implement the `CommercePaymentMethod` Interface

The following five methods are required:

```java
	public String getDescription(Locale locale);
```

```java
	public String getKey();
```

```java
	public String getName(Locale locale);
```

```java
	public int getPaymentType();
```

```java
	public String getServletPath();
```

To better understand each of the required methods mentioned above, let's look at [B1C3CommercePaymentMethod.java](./liferay-b1c3.zip/b1c3-impl/src/main/java/com/acme/b1c3/internal/commerce/payment/method/B1C3CommercePaymentMethod.java). We will review the implementation of each required method in sequence.

1. ```java
	@Override
	public String getDescription(Locale locale) {
		ResourceBundle resourceBundle = ResourceBundleUtil.getBundle(
			"content.Language", locale, getClass());

		return LanguageUtil.get(
			resourceBundle, "b1c3-commerce-payment-method-description");
	}
    ```

    >Populates the "Description" column in the Payment Methods administration page. `ResourceBundleUtil` is a Liferay class that provides support for multiple locales. Visit [Localizing Your Application](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018168251-Localizing-Your-Application) for more information.

1. ```java
	@Override
	public String getKey() {
		return "b1c3-commerce-payment-method-registry-key";
	}
    ```

    >Provides a unique identifier for the payment method in the registry. The key can be used to fetch the payment method from the registry programmatically if necessary. Reusing a key that is already in use will override the existing associated payment method.

1. ```java
	@Override
	public String getName(Locale locale) {
		ResourceBundle resourceBundle = ResourceBundleUtil.getBundle(
			"content.Language", locale, getClass());

		return LanguageUtil.get(
			resourceBundle, "b1c3-commerce-payment-method-name");
	}
    ```

    >Populates the "Name" column in the Payment Methods administration page. `ResourceBundleUtil` is a Liferay class that provides support for multiple locales. Visit [Localizing Your Application](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018168251-Localizing-Your-Application) for more information.

1. ```java
	@Override
	public int getPaymentType() {
		return CommercePaymentConstants.COMMERCE_PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE_OFFLINE;
	}
    ```

    >Identifies the way in which the payment engine will use a given payment method. In this example, `COMMERCE_PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE_OFFLINE` informs the payment engine that there are no online processing requirements for this payment method. There are two other payment type constants available out of the box: `COMMERCE_PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE_ONLINE_STANDARD` and `COMMERCE_PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE_ONLINE_REDIRECT`. For more information see [Implementing a New Online Payment Method](../implementing-a-new-online-payment-method/README.md).

1. ```java
	@Override
	public String getServletPath() {
		return null;
	}
    ```

    >When implementing an online payment method, a servlet may be required to enable proper interfacing with an external payment provider. Since no servlet path is required for an offline payment method, `getServletPath` should return `null`.

### Create the Payment Method

The following methods are necessary to define our custom payment method logic. There are many more methods that can be implemented that provide additional functionality - such as subscriptions, recurring payments, and refunds. These can be seen in [CommercePaymentMethod.java](https://github.com/liferay/com-liferay-commerce/blob/2.0.2/commerce-api/src/main/java/com/liferay/commerce/payment/method/CommercePaymentMethod.java). These methods come in pairs: one method to enable and the other to implement a given piece of functionality.

```java
@Override
public boolean isCompleteEnabled() {
	return true;
}
```

>For the payment method to complete payments, this must return true. `completePayment` is invoked when the payment is fulfilled. In this way we are indicating to the payment engine what functionality is supported by our payment method.

```java
@Override
public CommercePaymentResult completePayment(
		CommercePaymentRequest commercePaymentRequest)
	throws Exception {

	return new CommercePaymentResult(
		null, commercePaymentRequest.getCommerceOrderId(),
		CommerceOrderConstants.PAYMENT_STATUS_PAID, false, null, null,
		Collections.emptyList(), true);
}
```

>This is where custom payment logic will be implemented.  `CommercePaymentResult` is a simple container that stores information relevant to the completion of a payment process. For more information see [CommercePaymentResult.java](https://github.com/liferay/com-liferay-commerce/blob/2.0.2/commerce-api/src/main/java/com/liferay/commerce/payment/result/CommercePaymentResult.java).

```java
@Override
public boolean isProcessPaymentEnabled() {
	return true;
}
```

>For the payment method to process payments, this must return true. `processPayment` is the initial step that is executed when a customer submits an order. In this way we are indicating to the payment engine what functionality is supported by our payment method.

```java
@Override
public CommercePaymentResult processPayment(
		CommercePaymentRequest commercePaymentRequest)
	throws Exception {

	return new CommercePaymentResult(
		null, commercePaymentRequest.getCommerceOrderId(),
		CommerceOrderConstants.PAYMENT_STATUS_AUTHORIZED, false, null, null,
		Collections.emptyList(), true);
}
```

>This is where custom payment logic will be implemented. This `CommercePaymentResult` should store information relevant to the processing of a payment. For more information see [CommercePaymentResult.java](https://github.com/liferay/com-liferay-commerce/blob/2.0.2/commerce-api/src/main/java/com/liferay/commerce/payment/result/CommercePaymentResult.java)

Lastly, define the language key for our payment method's name and description. Add the keys and their values to a [Language.properties](./liferay-b1c3.zip/b1c3-impl/src/main/resources/content/Language.properties) file within our module:

```
b1c3-commerce-payment-method-description=This is the Acme Commerce Payment Method.
b1c3-commerce-payment-method-name=Acme Commerce Payment Method
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now know the basics for implementing the `CommercePaymentMethod` interface and have added a new basic payment method to Liferay Commerce.
